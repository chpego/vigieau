# Vigieau for home-assistant

Component to expose water restrictions in France through Vigieau api. See https://vigieau.gouv.fr/ for web access.

This integration share location via a 3rd party (government) website (as the website does).

Data is based on the [vigieau](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnee-secheresse-vigieau/) dataset. It's really great to have access to such data.

## Installation

It must be used as a custom repository via HACS.

## Configuration

Once the custom integration has been added, add "vigieau" integration through the UI.

You can choose the location either by using HA coordinates (default), giving a specific town zip code or select a point in a map.

HA coordinates are the one defined during initial setup and accessible using (`System>General>Edit location`)

Once a first location is added a new one can be added (using city zip code or a pin on a map)

### Using Zip Code
![image info](/img/location.png)

Localisation is based on INSEE Code, not ZIP/Postal code. If several INSEE code correspond to provided Zip code, manual selection will be required..

## Known issues and workaround

### Error communicating with API: Impossible to find approximate address of the current HA instance. API returned no result.

This integration uses a geocoding API to get the city code from INSEE (used as a input by Vigieau API). It is based on governement data which is still incomplete in some France areas.

A workaround can be used by setting the `VIGIEAU_FORCED_INSEE_CITY_CODE` environment variable with the city code as value.
âš  Value of city code is not necessarily city "postal code". You can find it easily of wikipedia under the name [code commune](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_officiel_g%C3%A9ographique#Code_commune).
